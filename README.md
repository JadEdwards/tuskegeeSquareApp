# tuskegeeSquareApp
I started this project in order to provide the students of Tuskegee University with a common space to view all campus businesses. 
I plan to finish this application by Fall of 2022. Business owners will be able to register their businesses and students will be able to 
create accounts to view businesses by category, prices and various other filters.
